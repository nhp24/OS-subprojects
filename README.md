# OS-subprojects
OS subprojects: Advanced Scheduler and Argument Passing in PintOS.
For references, there are 3 folders:
1) Folder "pintos" for initial pintos files. For some reasons, it is now a zip file.
2) Folder "pintos-AdSch" for the Advanced Scheduler assignment.
3) Folder "pintos-ArPa" for the Argument Passing assignment.
